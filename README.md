# FBLA 2019 Website Design Submission
Exports Latest Stable Version

## Introduction
This website is a light weight Node application that uses a templater to fit components in the webpage into place.
The website uses various plugins such as Bootstrap, AOS, TweenMax, Moment, and jQuery to help the website be
more responsive and create a better user expirience. The site also offers a REST API for all of the backend applications
such as form posts, plugin exports, and static images. I also introduced my own plugin called Templater to help create a Vue-like file templating environment for node.

## Ussage
To Start, make sure you have the latest version of node installed. Then clone the git repo and cd into it. <br>
Once in the repo, run the command:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the necesary plugins.<br>
Once complete, to run the application:
```
make dev
```
The Makefile helps create a better CLI expirience.<br>
Once the application is online, you can view it on port 9000, such as:<br>
http://localhost:9000
